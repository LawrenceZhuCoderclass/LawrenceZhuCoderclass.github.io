            <div class="box ProjectsText1">This is one game of my school research projects with Douwe Raat.
                The idea was that we research the capacity of holograms as a video game screen. The hologram effect we used were the pepper's ghost illusion and the Holofil.
                One of the games is PONG, but in 3D. It works on normal screens, Holofil and the pepper's ghost illusion.
                Here is a link to the github: <a class = "Link"  href = "https://github.com/LawrenceZhuCoderclass/Hologram-Pong/tree/master"> link</a>
            </div>
            <div class="box ProjectsText2">This is the second game of our school research project. 
                The second game is Tanks in 3D, Tanks is an old flash game where the main objective is to shoot the oppoising player with accuracy and power as main focus.
                This game's display options are the same as that of Pong 3D.

            </div>
            <div class="box ProjectsText3">This is my first game made (withouth using tutorials). It's a platformer where the main idea is that the player has limited vision.
The player has access to modes called 'visons', where each mode reveals a certain attribute of the level (platforms, ground, decoration)

            <div class="box ProjectsText4">This is my first VR game. I mainly wanted to focuss on the aestetics of the game to make the virtual reality worth it. 
                The game has a sci-fi setting, the player can mess around with the environment by interacting with objects. There is no real goal to the game, it was mostly a learning experience.
                Here a link to to the github: <a class = "Link" href = "https://github.com/LawrenceZhuCoderclass/Unity-vr-game/tree/master"> link</a>

            <div class="box ProjectsText5"> This is my first experience with cyber security other than capture the flag challenges.
                Here I followed a program made by the VU university, I learned about the main idea behind fuzzing and even did some assignments.
                The main assignments were about things like finding vulnerabilities in code, making a maze solver and making a custom fuzzer in AFL++
